		<h2>2010 WordPress Honor Awards</h2>

		<p>This site was the first major site released that was built using the new features added to WordPress 3.0 with all sorts of custom post types and cool features that were totally orignal. It gained more than by more than 5,000 members in the first month after it launched and it generated a lot of buzz within the WordPress community. The amount of user-generated content was huge and the number of prizes and free stuff generously donated by the 23 sponsors of the contest the site was based around was so large that 3 randomly chosen winning members of the site every single day for 3 months until the end of the year when the contest was over.</p>

		<p>The custom features for the dashboard and the user-facing side of the site were extensive. Consisting of everything from cool interactive front-end things to complete augmentation of the way that WordPress itself is built and normally functions. Everything that could be made to use Ajax did, like the voting button that enabled users to vote on entries of each category, and a lightbox that users could login/register from on any page, and when logged in the lightbox allowed them to post any of the 4 types of content they wanted without ever leaving that page. The dashboard had several features that were for all levels of access from regular members to editors, judges and admins. There was a prize inventory section just for keeping track of who won what and how many prizes were left from each sponsor. There was a custom post type for the judges that was made up of all the finalists from the user votes. Dashboard widgets that tracked the number of votes each submission had for each category and so many more things to list off.</p>

		<p>This was a revolutionary first of it's kind site, that was a lot of fun, and done entirely by myself. Check it out!!</p>
