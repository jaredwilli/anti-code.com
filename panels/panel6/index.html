				<p>Everything that could be made to use Ajax did, like the voting button that enabled users to vote on entries of each category, and a lightbox that users could login/register from on any page, and when logged in the lightbox allowed them to post any of the 4 types of content they wanted without ever leaving that page.</p>

				<p>The dashboard had several features that were for all levels of access from regular members to editors, judges and admins. There was a prize inventory section just for keeping track of who won what and how many prizes were left from each sponsor. There was a custom post type for the judges that was made up of all the finalists from the user votes. Dashboard widgets that tracked the number of votes each submission had for each category and so many more things to list off.</p>
