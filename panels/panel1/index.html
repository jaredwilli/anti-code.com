		<h2>CSS Off 2011 Contest Entry</h2>

		<a href="/examples/cssoff11/" target="_blank" class="project-link">View Site</a>
		
		<p>I made this site as my entry for the CSS Off contest in 2011 from the <a href="/examples/cssoff11/design/CSSOff-2011-Design.jpg" target="_blank" class="mockup">mockup that was provided</a> for coding this out. The design presented several various complex obstacles that had to be overcome and the goal was to create the best possible code for the site as possible based on a number of criteria that would be judged upon.</p>

		<ul class="gallery-thumbs">
			<li>
				<p>For the top of the site I made use of CSS3 multiple background images, and @font-face for customizing the fonts. Also, some minor CSS transforms for text rotating.</p>
				<a href="#slide-1" class="current">
					<img src="panels/panel1/thumb-1.png" alt="">
				</a>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>The second page was tricky to figure out the best way to show the obstacles using CSS hover states. Minimizing the amount of data the page had to load with all the images for thumbnails and fullsize was a matter of testing what was better done as a sprite. Also, making the text for each obstacle not part of the image involved CSS3 transforms and positioning of the backgrounds. The differing heights of the obstacles caused some issues too.</p>
				<a href="#slide-2">
					<img src="panels/panel1/thumb-2.png" alt="">
				</a>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>The prizes page was not as simple as it looks because the way the images needed to be floated did not make them wrap to a new line given the order and height difference. Each page has a yellow checkered heading that starts after the text. I managed to find a way to make each heading appear the way they needed to to the checkered square!</p>
				<a href="#slide-3">
					<img src="panels/panel1/thumb-3.png" alt="">
				</a>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>The register page had it's own custom styled select menus and a countdown timer that I made function and countdown from 60 seconds from the time the page loaded. I made my own select menus from the data of a regular one that I used as a fallback.</p>
				<a href="#slide-4">
					<img src="panels/panel1/thumb-4.png" alt="">
				</a>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>In the footer the left and right side needed to line in with the text center aligned mirroring and a horizontal rule that was separated by some text. I also included an easter egg in this page, see what happens when you type the word 'plaid'.</p>
				<a href="#slide-5">
					<img src="panels/panel1/thumb-5.png" alt="">
				</a>
			</li>
