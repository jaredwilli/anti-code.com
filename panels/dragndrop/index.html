		<h2>Rock Paper Scissors</h2>

		<p>
			I was asked by someone how I would psuedo-code a Rock Paper Scissors game in JavaScript. I thought it would be more fun to just try and make the game myself and decided to try. It took me about 2 hours to come up with a functional basic example of a working game.

			My main goal was to make a basic working example of this childhood classic game while using the least amount of code. As if it were for a JS1k.com contest for example only not minified to be under 1k yet.
