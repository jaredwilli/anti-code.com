		<h2>Canvas Star Shooter</h2>

		<p>
			This is a game I made using HTML5 Canvas. It's kind of like a pool game where you click on the circle at the bottom and drag down and use the line to control the direction which the ball will go. The objective is to hit all of the balls out of the circle.

			This game involves collision detection, physics concepts such as velocity and mass, and also user input via the mouse.
