		<p>As a developer, you need to know your tools for developing well. This is cheatsheet is something I put together to make a central location for all the shortcut keys and little tricks and hidden secrets within the Chrome Devtools.</p>

				<p>There are several shortcuts for doing all sorts of things in Devtools that include shortcuts that are global, for searching, and more. I am currently working to update the Shortcuts dialog that is in the Devtools settings panel so that it displays a more complete list, to eventually be more of a documentation reference which can be easily updated.</p>

				<p>The cheatsheet covers areas of the Devtools from global shortcuts, to shortcuts for each panel individually, to various things within Devtools that may not be so obvious. It also includes some Chrome flags and list of pages that can be useful too, as well as how to customize your Devtools theme. You can contribute to the cheatsheet at the project page on Github.com.</p>
