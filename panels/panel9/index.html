				<p>This is the new category page I built for the redesign of JBL.com. In this page along with the custom image slider is a sort of search wizard that was for finding products based on specific criteria. All dynamically updated with sliding hidden content areas and front-end goodies.</p>

				<p>The product recommender included things on the front-end like a price range slider, and horizontal sliding product pagination. Also, automatic reloading of the product list as each of the options are changed.</p>
