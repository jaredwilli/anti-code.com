		<h2>JBL.com Product Recommender</h2>

		<p>
			This is a feature I built for <a href="">JBL.com</a> that was a type of search wizard for finding products based on specific criteria. It includes a price range slider, sliding product paging, and automatic reloading of the product list as each of the options are changed.
