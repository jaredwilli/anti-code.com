		<h1>HTML5 Drag and Drop Example</h1>
		<h2>About</h2>
		<p>This is an example I made of how to implement HTML5 drag and drop features to make it possible to rearrange the images displayed on the right. You can click and drag them around to different places to organize them however you like.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>This is a completely client-side example. No server-side code is used to store the new photo order.</li>
			<li>While this example is using jQuery to do simple class adding and removing, the use of 3rd party libraries is not entirely needed. I made all the event handlers and DOM manipulations using straight conventional JavaScript.</li>
			<li>This is example is functional in the browsers: Safari, Chrome, Firefox, and Internet Explorer 8 and 9.</li>
		</ul>
