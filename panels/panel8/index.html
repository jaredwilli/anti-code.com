		<p>New2WP is one of my personal WordPress blog sites which I designed and developed, and wrote all the content for. There are some very in-depth tutorials and resourceful articles for people who are learning WordPress and JavaScript which show how to do some things that you won't find on any of the other similar types of WordPress tutorial blogs.</p>

				<p>The homepage of New2WP has a custom built randomly post slider which showcases a random set of posts that are within the 'featured' category of the site. One of the most popular posts which was also one of the first that I posted after launching the site is a very in-depth 3 part tutorial series which shows how to build both a static version and a dynamic version of the exact same slider which is used on the homepage.</p>
				
				<p>The design of the site was one of the more intricately detailed designs that I had created and then fully coded out entirely at that time. I do look back at it now and wonder what I was thinking with a large amount of the code, such is life though I suppose. It was quite a learning experience in building it out, as well as how useful it came to be for writing about everything I learned from there on after.</p>

				<p>New2WP at one time had a decent following and was up there with some of the more prominant WP tutorial blogs, until I decided to go another way making my main focus developing just on the front-end.</p>

				<p>There are many customized, modified or overriden features that are native to WordPress included in this site. The dashboard for example has a design matching that of the main site. I also added a custom post type for posting new code snippets so I could easily share a quick post with some useful code snippets, and all kinds of other things.</p>
				
				<p>I would really love to redesign and develop from scratch the whole site over using HTML5 and all the front-end sexiness that I love so much now, if only I were still interested in doing WordPress themes, but perhaps some day I may.</p>
