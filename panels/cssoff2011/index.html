	<h2>2011 CSS Off Contest</h2>

	<p>This is the site I built for the CSS Off contest for 2011 which I submitted as my entry. This design was a mockup that was provided for the contest. The person who created the best resulting code for this single-page site was the winner. The design presented several various complex obstacles that had to be overcome. In my entry I made use of CSS3 features such as multiple background images, @font-face, transforms and more. The layout of each page had some challenging requirements.</p>
