		<h2>Samsung Olympic Genome Project</h2>

		<p>I worked on this project for about 8 months when I was at Isobar and lead the development of the front-end for about 6 of those months after inheriting the lead role. The Olympic Genome Project was a complex Facebook data visualization app and interactive gaming experience built with Canvas and HTML5 to display information within a single animated page the different ways which consumers are connected to Olympic athletes. A community within a social network to incorporate the social graph and users profile data to find matching data from USOC to create different degrees of separation.</p>
