		I was asked by someone how I would psuedo-code a Rock Paper Scissors game in JavaScript. I thought it would be more fun to just try and make the game myself and decided to try. It took me about 2 hours to come up with a functional basic example of a working game.

	<p>
		My main goal was to make a basic working example of this childhood classic game while using the least amount of code. As if it were for a JS1k.com contest for example only not minified to be under 1k yet.

    <p>This is a simple game I made. It was a quick and dirty hack session I did for 2 hours after someone asked me how to psuedo code this game. Rather than psuedo code how I would do it, I just made it. It gave me something to do and I wanted to see how long it would take and how hard it would be to do.</p>
