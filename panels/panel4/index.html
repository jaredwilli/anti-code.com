				<p>The Olympic Genome Project was a complex Facebook data visualization app and interactive gaming experience built with Canvas and HTML5 to display information within a single animated page the different ways which consumers are connected to Olympic athletes.</p>

				<p>I worked on this project for about 8 months when I was at Isobar and lead the development of the front-end for about 6 of those months after inheriting the lead role. A community within a social network to incorporate the social graph and users profile data to find matching data from USOC to create different degrees of separation.</p>

				<p>The second page was tricky to figure out the best way to show the obstacles using CSS hover states. Minimizing the amount of data the page had to load with all the images for thumbnails and fullsize was a matter of testing what was better done as a sprite. Also, making the text for each obstacle not part of the image involved CSS3 transforms and positioning of the backgrounds. The differing heights of the obstacles caused some issues too.</p>
