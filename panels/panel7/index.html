        I was asked by someone how I would psuedo-code a Rock Paper Scissors game in JavaScript. I thought it would be more fun to just try and make the game myself and decided to try. It was a quick and dirty hack that took me about 2 hours to come up with a functional basic example of a working game.

        My main goal was to make a basic working example of this childhood classic game while using the least amount of code. I could take this any number of ways. The JavaScript is structured within an object using the module pattern.
